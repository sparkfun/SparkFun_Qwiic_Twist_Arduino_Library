  basically do whatever you want with this code.

  This example shows how to set the knob color to pink. This value is stored in the 
  Qwiic Twist and will be loaded after each power-on.

  Also - the max I2C datarate for Qwiic Twist is 400kHz
  
  Feel like supporting open source hardware?
  Buy a board from SparkFun! https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15083

  Hardware Connections:
  Plug a Qwiic cable into the Qwiic Twist and a BlackBoard
  If you don't have a platform with a Qwiic connection use the SparkFun Qwiic Breadboard Jumper (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14425)
  Open the serial monitor at 115200 baud to see the output
