  basically do whatever you want with this code.

  This example shows how to change the I2C address of the Qwiic Twist.
  Valid addresses are 0x08 to 0x77 - 111 possible addresses!
  Device's I2C address is stored to memory and loaded on each power-on

  Feel like supporting open source hardware?
  Buy a board from SparkFun! https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15083

  Hardware Connections:
  Plug a Qwiic cable into the Qwiic Twist and a BlackBoard
  If you don't have a platform with a Qwiic connection use the SparkFun Qwiic Breadboard Jumper (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14425)
  Open the serial monitor at 115200 baud to see the output
