  basically do whatever you want with this code.

  This example shows how to set the encoder count. There are times when it's necessary
  encoder count to a specific value. Useful when the encoder value is mapped directly
  onto a volume setting, FM freq, etc.

  Feel like supporting open source hardware?
  Buy a board from SparkFun! https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15083

  Hardware Connections:
  Plug a Qwiic cable into the Qwiic Twist and a BlackBoard
  If you don't have a platform with a Qwiic connection use the SparkFun Qwiic Breadboard Jumper (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14425)
  Open the serial monitor at 115200 baud to see the output
