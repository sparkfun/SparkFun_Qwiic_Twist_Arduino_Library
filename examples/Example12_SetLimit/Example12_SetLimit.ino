  Read and interact with the SparkFun Qwiic Twist digital RGB encoder

  License: MIT. See license file for more information but you can
  basically do whatever you want with this code.

  This example shows how to set the max encoder value. For example,
  setting the limit to 359 will not allow the encoder read values to
  go above 359, looping back to zero instead. Useful when the encoder
  value is mapped directly onto a volume setting, FM freq, etc.

  This feature is available on Qwiic Twist firmware v1.2 and above.

  Feel like supporting open source hardware?
  Buy a board from SparkFun! https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15083

  Hardware Connections:
  Plug a Qwiic cable into the Qwiic Twist and a BlackBoard
  If you don't have a platform with a Qwiic connection use the SparkFun Qwiic Breadboard Jumper (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14425)
  Open the serial monitor at 115200 baud to see the output
